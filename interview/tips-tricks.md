## üöÄ Essential Tips

### Before the Interview

#### 1. **Master the Fundamentals**
- **Scalability**: Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
- **Availability**: 99.9% vs 99.99% uptime
- **Consistency**: CAP theorem, ACID vs BASE
- **Performance**: Latency, throughput, bottlenecks

#### 2. **Practice Common Problems**
- URL shortener, chat app, social media
- E-commerce, video streaming, search
- Payment systems, recommendation engines

#### 3. **Know Your Numbers**
```
- 1 million users = 1M
- 1 billion users = 1B
- Storage: 1KB, 1MB, 1GB, 1TB
- Time: 1ms, 1s, 1min, 1hour
- Network: 1Mbps, 1Gbps
```

### During the Interview

#### 1. **Start with Clarification**
```
‚ùå Don't: Jump straight into design
‚úÖ Do: Ask clarifying questions first

Examples:
- "What's the expected user base?"
- "What are the main features?"
- "Any specific performance requirements?"
- "What's the read vs write ratio?"
```

#### 2. **Use the 4-Step Framework**

**Step 1: Scale Estimation**
```
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Storage requirements
- Bandwidth needs
```

**Step 2: High-Level Architecture**
```
- Load Balancer
- Web Servers
- Application Servers
- Database (Primary/Replica)
- Cache Layer
- CDN
```

**Step 3: Deep Dive**
```
- Database schema design
- API endpoints
- Data partitioning
- Caching strategy
- Security considerations
```

**Step 4: Trade-offs**
```
- Consistency vs Availability
- Performance vs Cost
- Complexity vs Maintainability
```

#### 3. **Communication Tips**

**Use Visual Aids**
- Draw diagrams on whiteboard
- Use boxes for components
- Show data flow with arrows
- Label everything clearly

**Think Aloud**
```
‚ùå Don't: Silent thinking
‚úÖ Do: "I'm thinking about the database choice..."

"I'm considering using Redis for caching because..."
"Let me think about the trade-offs between..."
```

**Ask for Feedback**
```
"Does this approach make sense?"
"Would you like me to elaborate on any part?"
"Should I consider any other aspects?"
```

## üéØ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Over-Engineering**
```
‚ùå Don't: Start with microservices for 1000 users
‚úÖ Do: Start simple, scale when needed
```

### 2. **Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements**
```
‚ùå Don't: Focus only on features
‚úÖ Do: Consider scalability, availability, security
```

### 3. **Not Estimating Scale**
```
‚ùå Don't: Design without numbers
‚úÖ Do: Always estimate users, data, traffic
```

### 4. **Poor Communication**
```
‚ùå Don't: Assume interviewer knows your thoughts
‚úÖ Do: Explain your reasoning clearly
```

## üìä Scale Estimation Cheat Sheet

### User Base Estimation
```
- Small: 1K - 10K users
- Medium: 10K - 1M users
- Large: 1M - 100M users
- Massive: 100M+ users
```

### Storage Estimation
```
- User profile: 1KB
- Post/Message: 1KB
- Image: 1MB
- Video: 100MB
- Database index: 10% of data
```

### Traffic Estimation
```
- Read-heavy: 80% reads, 20% writes
- Write-heavy: 20% reads, 80% writes
- Balanced: 50% reads, 50% writes
```

## üîß Technology Choices

### Databases
```
- Relational: MySQL, PostgreSQL (ACID, complex queries)
- NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra (scalability, flexibility)
- Cache: Redis, Memcached (speed, temporary data)
- Search: Elasticsearch (full-text search)
```

### Message Queues
```
- RabbitMQ: Complex routing
- Apache Kafka: High throughput
- Redis Pub/Sub: Simple messaging
```

### Load Balancers
```
- Application: HAProxy, Nginx
- Network: AWS ALB, Google Cloud LB
- Global: CloudFlare, AWS CloudFront
```

## üìà Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling
```
- Add more servers
- Use load balancers
- Distribute data across nodes
```

### Vertical Scaling
```
- Increase server resources
- Better hardware
- Optimize code
```

### Database Scaling
```
- Read replicas
- Sharding
- Caching
- CDN for static content
```

## üéØ Interview Questions Framework

### 1. **Functional Requirements**
- What features do we need?
- What are the core use cases?
- What's the user journey?

### 2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
- How many users?
- What's the expected latency?
- How much data?
- What's the availability requirement?

### 3. **Constraints**
- Budget limitations?
- Technology preferences?
- Compliance requirements?
- Time constraints?

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. **Start Simple**
```
"Let me start with a simple design and then optimize..."
```

### 2. **Show Iteration**
```
"First, let's handle 1M users, then scale to 100M..."
```

### 3. **Consider Edge Cases**
```
"What happens if the database goes down?"
"How do we handle data consistency?"
```

### 4. **Discuss Trade-offs**
```
"Using Redis improves performance but adds complexity..."
```

### 5. **End with Summary**
```
"To summarize, we have a scalable system that can handle..."
```

## üéØ Sample Interview Flow

### 1. **Clarify Requirements (5 min)**
```
Interviewer: "Design a URL shortener"
You: "Let me clarify a few things:
- How many URLs per day?
- What's the expected user base?
- Any specific requirements for URL length?
- Do we need analytics?"
```

### 2. **Estimate Scale (5 min)**
```
"Assuming 100M URLs per day:
- 100M writes/day = ~1,200 writes/second
- 10:1 read/write ratio = 12,000 reads/second
- Each URL ~500 bytes = 50GB/day storage"
```

### 3. **High-Level Design (10 min)**
```
"Components:
- Load Balancer
- Web Servers
- URL Generation Service
- Database (Primary + Replicas)
- Cache Layer
- Analytics Service"
```

### 4. **Deep Dive (15 min)**
```
"Database Schema:
- URLs table: id, original_url, short_code, created_at
- Analytics table: short_code, clicks, timestamp

API Design:
- POST /shorten
- GET /{short_code}
- GET /analytics/{short_code}"
```

### 5. **Trade-offs (5 min)**
```
"Using hash-based URLs vs sequential IDs:
- Hash: Shorter, but collision risk
- Sequential: Longer, but guaranteed unique"
```

## üéâ Success Formula

**Preparation + Practice + Communication = Success**

1. **Study** the fundamentals
2. **Practice** common problems
3. **Communicate** clearly during interview
4. **Iterate** and improve based on feedback
